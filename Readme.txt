Brief introduction:
I use RecyclerView with customized row_recyclerview.xml inside MainActivity to display each task. The RecyclerView needs MyAdapter to handle some binding view issues with each item. I also create Task data class to make each task as an object for easier storing and editing. Finally, I use AlertDialog with customized dialog_new_task.xml to display the new/edit task dialog.

Hours to complete: 12

Most challenging:
It's hard to understand the logic and implementation behind the RecyclerView, such as how to assign item, update and notify data change, assign actions to each item when being clicked, etc.
